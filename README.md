# The CyberHub Project

The official repo of the UA Cyber Saguaros CyberHub project.

**Project Description**

The CyberHub is the official cyber warfare range and eLearning platform of the Cyber Saguaros, the University of Arizona's largest cybersecurity club. The CyberHub's purpose is split into three main goals that guide our effort throughout this project:
1. Provide club members with the opportunity to supplement their undergraduate and graduate-level coursework with hands-on offensive and defensive security training.
2. Create a training model & environment for club Capture the Flag (CTF) teams.
3. Stay free for club members.

**Project Components**

Here are the main components that will make up the CyberHub:
1. The Hub - The website/landing page where users authorize and get access to the other sections of the CyberHub.
2. Saguaros University - Moodle eLearning platform (LMS) with courses and digital badges.
3. The Crucible - A fully featured, CTF-style cyber warfare range with vulnerable hosts, networking devices, and enterprise environments. 
4. Library - An organized, properly indexed repository of eBooks, PDF guides, and cybersecurity resources.
5. Cyber Wiki - A wiki with vulnerable machine walkthroughs, red/blue team skill playbooks, cheat sheets, and the CyberHub project documentation.
