# CyberHub-Project

The official repo of the UA Cyber Saguaros CyberHub project.

**CyberHub Project Description**

The CyberHub is the official cyber warfare range and eLearning platform of the Cyber Saguaros, the University of Arizona's largest cybersecurity club. The CyberHub's purpose is split into three main goals that guide our effort throughout this project:
1. Provide club members with the opportunity to supplement their undergraduate and graduate-level coursework with hands-on offensive and defensive security training.
2. Create a training model & environment for club Capture the Flag (CTF) teams.
3. Stay free for club members.
